# Files Overview
# .bashrc - interactive non-login shells (or subshells)
# .bash_profile - read at login only bash shell
# .profile - read at login many by shells
# *tmux can reload login shells (if login command bash -l), each time which needs to be corrected

# .profile
# .profile is for things that are not specifically related to Bash, like environment variables PATH and friends, and should be available anytime.
#  For example, .profile should also be loaded when starting a graphical desktop session.

# .bashrc
# .bashrc is for the configuring the interactive Bash usage, like Bash aliases, setting your favorite editor, setting the Bash prompt, etc.

# .bash_profile
# .bash_profile is for making sure that both the things in .profile and .bashrc are loaded for login shells.
# For example, .bash_profile could be something simple like
#   . ~/.profile
#   . ~/.bashrc
# If you were to omit .bash_profile, only .profile would be loaded.
